- questions: [QuestionSchema]
- timeLimit: Number (minutes)
- startDate: Date
- endDate: Date
- maxAttempts: Number (default: 1)
- instructions: String
- allowTabSwitch: Boolean (default: false)
- isActive: Boolean (default: true)
```

**AssessmentResult Model** (`server/models/AssessmentResult.js`)
```javascript
- student: ObjectId (ref: User)

- attemptNumber: Number
- tabSwitches: Number
- warnings: Number
- status: String (enum: ["In Progress", "Completed", "Abandoned"])
- startedAt: Date
- submittedAt: Date
```

#### 2. API Endpoints

**Instructor Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/assessment/create` - Create new assessment
- `GET /api/v1/assessment/course/:courseId` - Get course assessments
- `GET /api/v1/assessment/:assessmentId/results` - Get assessment results
- `PUT /api/v1/assessment/:assessmentId` - Update assessment
- `DELETE /api/v1/assessment/:assessmentId` - Delete assessment

**Student Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/assessment/available/:courseId` - Get available assessments
- `GET /api/v1/assessment/student/:assessmentId` - Get assessment for student
- `POST /api/v1/assessment/:assessmentId/start` - Start assessment attempt
- `POST /api/v1/assessment/submit/:attemptId` - Submit assessment

#### 3. Controller Logic

The `Assessment.js` controller includes comprehensive validation and business logic:

- **Validation**: Ensures all required fields are present and valid
- **Authorization**: Verifies instructor ownership and student enrollment
- **Time Management**: Handles assessment availability windows
- **Attempt Management**: Tracks and limits student attempts
- **Scoring**: Calculates scores and percentages automatically
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access and manipulation

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Assessment Interface (`src/pages/Assessment.jsx`)

**Key Features:**
- Real-time countdown timer
- Question navigation with progress tracking
- Tab switching detection with warnings
- Answer selection and persistence
- Auto-submission on time expiry
- Session management

**Tab Switching Detection:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleVisibilityChange = () => {
    if (!document.hidden && assessment && !assessment.allowTabSwitch) {
      setTabSwitches(prev => prev + 1)
      setWarnings(prev => prev + 1)
      setShowWarning(true)
      
      setTimeout(() => setShowWarning(false), 3000)
    }
  }

  document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange)
  window.addEventListener('blur', handleBlur)
  
  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange)
    window.removeEventListener('blur', handleBlur)
  }
}, [assessment])
```

#### 2. Assessment Creation (`src/components/core/Dashboard/CreateAssessment.jsx`)

**Features:**
- Dynamic question and option management
- Form validation and error handling
- Date and time configuration
- Settings for tab switching and attempts
- Real-time form preview

#### 3. Assessment Management (`src/components/core/Dashboard/AssessmentManagement.jsx`)

**Instructor Dashboard Features:**
- View all course assessments
- Access to results and analytics
- Assessment status tracking (Upcoming, Active, Completed)
- Quick actions for management

#### 4. Student Assessment View (`src/components/core/Dashboard/StudentAssessments.jsx`)

**Student Dashboard Features:**
- Available assessments listing
- Attempt status tracking
- Assessment details and instructions
- Quick access to start assessments

#### 5. Results Display (`src/pages/AssessmentResults.jsx`)

**Results Features:**
- Comprehensive score breakdown

## Security Measures

### 1. Tab Switching Detection

The system implements multiple layers of tab switching detection:

```javascript
// Visibility API detection
document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange)

// Window focus detection
window.addEventListener('blur', handleBlur)

// Page focus detection
document.addEventListener('focus', handleFocus)
```

### 2. Session Security

- **Server-side validation**: All requests are validated on the server
- **Authentication required**: All endpoints require valid authentication tokens
- **Authorization checks**: Instructors can only manage their own assessments
- **Enrollment verification**: Students can only access assessments for enrolled courses

### 3. Data Integrity

- **Atomic operations**: Database operations are atomic to prevent race conditions
- **Validation layers**: Multiple validation layers prevent invalid data
- **Audit trails**: All actions are logged with timestamps and user information
